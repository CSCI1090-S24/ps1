# Problem Set 1

Now that you have created a GitHub account and have accepted this invitation, you can finish the problem set. Here are the components that must be submitted by the deadline, January 19, at 11:59pm:

1. Personalized slide
2. Survey
3. Slack post
4. IDLE command line screenshot
5. Your first Python program

## Part 1: Make a Personalized Slide
1. Using PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides, create a single landscape mode PDF that contains the following information.

* Your name as it appears in Canvas.
* The name you prefer to be called.
* A photo of you that resembles what you currently look like.

2. Put your PDF in this directory. You will not get full credit if you do not submit a PDF.

## Part 2: Course Survey
Take this short survey: https://forms.gle/c6LJ2QyRxktytCPa8

## Part 3: Get started on Slack
Follow [this link to join the Slack workspace for this class](https://join.slack.com/t/csci1090s24/shared_invite/zt-2anzsi28g-kcsiPnm04dhh4q7sAsuGhw). Create your account if you don't have one and feel free to use a pseudonym for your username. Then post a message in the `#general` channel. Don't forget to `@prudhome` if you need my attention.

## Part 4: Install Anaconda
There are many different ways to write and run Python code. We will be exploring several of them in this class, but we will start by using Anaconda.
Anaconda is a platform for writing and running Python programs that includes a lot of optional libraries (extra functionality) that are not normally included with the basic version of Python. Using Anaconda will allow us to skip over the frustration of installing libraries and making sure everything is installed in the right place. As you become a stronger programmer, you will likely manage your Python installation yourself. 

Follow the instructions for installing Anaconda for your particular operating system:
* [Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/#installing-on-windows)
* [Mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/mac-os/#wizard-install)
* [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/linux/#installing-on-linux))

Please take the suggestions and recommendation.

### Part 5: Type some Python code!

1. Launch the **IDLE** application (*not* python.exe or Python launcher.app).

2. This will open a window that looks something like this.

3. Next to the ``>>>`` type a mathematical expression, like ``2+7`` or ``56/8``. Then hit return.

4. Now type your own personalized greeting to me and the TAs using the ``print`` command. Here's an example, below, of how the command should look, but you will replace ``Hello, world!`` with your own greeting. Don't forget to hit return after you type your command.

```print("Hello, world!")```

5. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing that you typed these commands, and submit it to the Canvas assignment for Problem Set 1.
