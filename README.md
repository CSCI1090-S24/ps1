 # Problem Set 1

Now that you have created a GitHub account and have accepted this invitation, you can finish the problem set. Here are the components that must be submitted by the deadline, January 19, at 11:59pm:

1. Personalized PDF slide
2. Survey
3. Slack post
4. IDLE command line screenshot
5. Your first Python program

## Part 1: Make a Personalized Slide
1. Using PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides, create a single landscape mode PDF that contains the following information.

* Your name as it appears in Canvas.
* The name you prefer to be called.
* A photo of you that resembles what you currently look like.

2. Put your PDF in this directory. You will not get full credit if you do not submit a PDF.

## Part 2: Course Survey
Take this short survey: https://forms.gle/c6LJ2QyRxktytCPa8

## Part 3: Get started on Slack
Follow [this link to join the Slack workspace for this class](https://join.slack.com/t/csci1090s24/shared_invite/zt-2anzsi28g-kcsiPnm04dhh4q7sAsuGhw). Create your account if you don't have one and feel free to use a pseudonym for your username. Then post a message in the `#general` channel. Don't forget to `@prudhome` if you need my attention.

## Part 4: Download and Install GitHub Desktop
In this class, most assignments will be distributed and submitted using GitHub Classroom. The easiest way to manage GitHub for new users is through the GitHub Desktop application.

1. [Download GitHub Desktop from here.](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Find the installer in your Downloads folder (or wherever things get downloaded on your computer), then double click the installer to install GitHub Desktop. In most cases, this will install the program in your Downloads folder.
3. Launch GitHub Desktop. When you do this, it might ask you if you want to move it to a more appropriate location (e.g., Applications). You should agree to this, but remember where it is getting moved to so you can find it easily later! I suggest making a shortcut or alias on your Desktop.
4. Since you have already created a GitHub account in the first part of this problem set, you should sign in to GitHub.com when prompted.

## Part 5: Clone this repository to your own machine


## Part 6: Download and install Python

1. Download Python for your operating system by clicking the big yellow "Download Python" button found on this webpage: https://www.python.org/downloads/. It's okay if the version number is different. Python gets updated frequently!

2. Double click on the downloaded file to install Python on your computer. Answer the questions that the installer asks you and keep clicking the "Continue" button. You might have to enter your computer's password to complete the installation.

# *Important note for Windows users: You **must** check the box in the first dialogue window that says "Add Python 3.12 to PATH"!*

3. After installation is complete, your computer will probably open a window showing you where the various Python components were installed. On a Mac, it's in Applications by default. In Windows, the default location is in Programs. If you are having trouble finding the Python components you just installed, you can always search for "python" or "idle" the way you would search for any other file or program (e.g., with the Start menu in Python, or with Spotlight, the magnifying glass in the upper right corner on Mac). Here's a screenshot from my Mac showing where the installer installed Python.

4. Make a shortcut or alias to the IDLE application to your desktop so you always know where to find it.


## Part 7: Write and run Python code from the IDLE interpreter

1. Launch the **IDLE** application (*not* python.exe or Python launcher.app).

2. This will open a window that looks something like this.

3. Next to the ``>>>`` type a mathematical expression, like ``2+7`` or ``56/8``. Then hit return.

4. Now type your own personalized greeting to me and the TAs using the ``print`` command. Here's an example, below, of how the command should look, but you will replace ``Hello, world!`` with your own greeting. Don't forget to hit return after you type your command.

```print("Hello, world!")```

5. Take a screenshot of your IDLE window showing that you typed these commands, and submit it to the Canvas assignment for Problem Set 1.

## Part 8: Write and run a Python program




## Part 9: Commit your work to GitHub Classroom using the GitHub Desktop app
